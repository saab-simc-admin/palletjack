Domain
======

Type name: domain

Represents a DNS domain.

The link "ip_network" points to the IP network corresponding to this
DNS domain.

This information is used by the tools "palletjack2kea", to write the
domain name in the DHCP configuration, and "palletjack2zone", to write
zone files for a DNS server. If the ip_network link points to a
network which has its netblock in CIDR form in the key "net.ip.cidr",
and the netmask length is a whole number of octets (i.e. 0, 8, 16 or
24 bits), "palletjack2zone" will also write reverse zones for all
defined IP addresses.
