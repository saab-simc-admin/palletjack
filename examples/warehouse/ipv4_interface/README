IPv4 interface
==============

Type name: ipv4_interface

Represents an IPv4 configuration on a network interface.

Each ipv4_interface has exactly one IPv4 address, which is its name.
To configure several IP addresses on the same physical interface,
create additional ipv4_interface objects with links to the same
phy_nic object.

The link "domain" points to the DNS domain this interface is a part
of.

The link "ipv4_network" points to the IPv4 network this interface is
attached to.

The link "phy_nic" points to the underlying Ethernet interface this
IPv4 interface runs on.

The link "system" points to the system in which this interface is
configured.

This information is used by all tools handling network configuration,
currently "palletjack2kea", "palletjack2pxelinux" and
"palletjack2zone".

The phy_nic linked from this ipv4_interface may be a virtual
interface, if the system runs on a virtual machine.


Links:

  ipv4_interface/<name>/domain -> ../../domain/<name>/
  ipv4_interface/<name>/ipv4_network -> ../../ipv4_network/<name>/
  ipv4_interface/<name>/phy_nic -> ../../phy_nic/<name>/
  ipv4_interface/<name>/system -> ../../system/<name>/
