# Value transformation rules
# ==========================
#
# Since the data in the warehouse files is to be written by humans, we
# don't want to have to repeat information. Instead, write each piece
# of information once and use transformation rules in this file to
# expand that into the forms expected by later tools.
#
#
# YAML structure:
#
# - <key>:
#   - <synthesizing rule>
#   - <synthesizing rule>
#   ...
# - <key>:
#   - <synthesizing rule>
#   - <synthesizing rule>
#   ...
# ...
#
# Synthesize a value for each key according to the rules. Keys are
# processed in order top to bottom, so later rules may use synthesized
# values from earlier processed keys.
#
# Rules are processed in order top to bottom, and the first one to
# produce a value is used.
#
# Two synthesizing rules are currently defined: "synthesize" and
# "synthesize_regexp".
#
#
# synthesize
# ----------
#
# YAML structure:
#
#   - synthesize: "rule"
#
# or
#
#   - synthesize:
#     - "rule"
#     - "rule"
#     ...
#
# Rules are strings used to build the new value. The value of another
# key is inserted by "#[key]", and all other characters are copied
# verbatim.
#
# Rules are evaluated in order, and the first one to
# successfully produce a value without failing a key lookup is
# used.
#
# Example:
#
#   - net.dns.fqdn:
#     - synthesize: "#[net.ip.name].#[domain.name]"
#
#   - chassis.nic.name:
#     - synthesize:
#       - "p#[chassis.nic.pcislot]p#[chassis.nic.port]"
#       - "em#[chassis.nic.port]"
#
#
# synthesize_regexp
# -----------------
#
# YAML structure:
#
#   - synthesize_regexp:
#       sources:
#         source0:
#           key: "key"
#           regexp: "regexp"
#         source1:
#           key: "key"
#           regexp: "regexp"
#         ...
#       produce: "recipe"
#
# where:
#
# sourceN Arbitrary number of sources for partial values, with arbitrary
#         names
#
# key     Name of the key to read a partial value from
#
# regexp  Regular expression for parsing the value indicated by "key",
#         with named captures used to save substrings for producing the
#         final value. Capture names must not be repeated within the same
#         "synthesize_regexp" block.
#
# produce A recipe for building the new value. Named captures are
#         inserted by "#[capture]", and all other characters are copied
#         verbatim.
#
# Example:
#
# Take strings like "192.168.0.0_24" from "pallet.ip_network" and
# produce strings like "192.168.0.0/24" in "net.ip.cidr".
#
#  - net.ip.cidr:
#    - synthesize_regexp:
#        sources:
#          ip_network:
#            key: "pallet.ip_network"
#            regexp: "^(?<network>[0-9.]+)_(?<prefix_length>[0-9]+)$"
#        produce: "#[network]/#[prefix_length]"


# Default transforms
# ==================
#
# *.name:
#
#   The name of an object is the name of the directory it resides in.
#   To prevent us having to repeat that information in the YAML data,
#   read the object names from the links (in the "pallet." namespace)
#   and populate a "*.name" key.

- location.room.name:
  - synthesize: "#[pallet.room]"
- location.building.name:
  - synthesize: "#[pallet.building]"
- location.room.name:
  - synthesize: "#[pallet.room]"
- chassis.name:
  - synthesize: "#[pallet.chassis]"
- net.domain.name:
  - synthesize: "#[pallet.domain]"
- location.room.name:
  - synthesize: "#[pallet.room]"
- location.rack.name:
  - synthesize: "#[pallet.rack]"
- system.name:
  - synthesize: "#[pallet.system]"
- net.ip.name:                     # Later rules can reference previously
  - synthesize: "#[system.name]"   # synthesized values


# These keys have the same data as "*.name" above, but have actual
# mening to their names in addition to identification, so use keys
# named for the purpose of the data instead of "name".

- system.os:
  - synthesize: "#[pallet.os]"
- net.ip.address:
  - synthesize: "#[pallet.ip_nic]"
- net.mac.address:
  - synthesize: "#[pallet.phy_nic]"


# Simple pasting of previous values to synthesize a new one. Note that
# we are, again, accessing a previously synthesized value.

- net.dns.fqdn:
  - synthesize: "#[net.ip.name].#[net.domain.name]"


# A list of synthesizing rules is processed from top to bottom, and
# the first one to produce a value is used. In this case, if
# "chassis.nic.pcislot" doesn't exist, the first rule fails and the
# second one takes over.

- chassis.nic.name:
  - synthesize:
      - "p#[chassis.nic.pcislot]p#[chassis.nic.port]"
      - "em#[chassis.nic.port]"


# Regexp synthesizing rules. ip_network objects are named like
# "192.168.0.0_24", so with a regexp like
# "^(?<network>[0-9.]+)_(?<prefix_length>[0-9]+)$" the named captures
# are bound to network:"192.168.0.0" and prefix_length:"24",
# respectively.
#
# Different tools reading the data later will need either the prefix
# length or the entire netblock in CIDR format, so we produce both
# forms. A little repetition here allows us to have much simpler tools
# later in the chain.

- net.ip.prefixlen:
  - synthesize_regexp:

      produce: "#[prefix_length]"
- net.ip.cidr:
  - synthesize_regexp:

        ip_network:
          key: "pallet.ip_network"
