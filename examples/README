Examples
========

warehouse
---------

A sample warehouse with fake data, to demonstrate the features of
Pallet Jack.


palletjack_yaml_file.py
-----------------------

Salt external pillar for reading YAML files containing data exported
from the warehouse by palletjack2salt.

Place this file in your Salt pillar module directory, e.g.
/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/salt/pillar/, and use it by adding
this to your Salt master configuration:

  ext_pillar:
    - palletjack_yaml_file: /var/cache/palletjack/{environment}/{minion}.yaml

Then, install a Git hook that runs palletjack2salt after the warehouse
has been updated.


pxelinux
--------

Example PXELINUX configuration, compatible with the output generated
by palletjack2pxelinux. The contents of this directory are meant to be
placed in the root of the TFTP server, along with an installation of
PXELINUX.

For the Kickstart PXELINUX profiles to work, there needs to be an HTTP
server at "http://kickstart/", serving Kickstart files out of its root
directory. See the default transform rule for "host.kickstart.ksurl".

The PXELINUX boot menu configuration is based on the example at
http://www.syslinux.org/wiki/index.php?title=PXELINUX#Custom_Menu_Example_with_sub-menus.

Actual boot files belonging to external utilities are not included in
this repository.

For Memtest86+, download
http://www.memtest.org/download/4.20/memtest86+-4.20.bin.gz and unpack
it as pxelinux/boot/memtest.4.20.

For the CentOS 7 installer, download
http://mirror.centos.org/centos/7/os/x86_64/images/pxeboot/vmlinuz and
http://mirror.centos.org/centos/7/os/x86_64/images/pxeboot/initrd.img
to pxelinux/boot/CentOS-7.3.1611-x86_64/.
